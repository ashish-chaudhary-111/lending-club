# Lending Club
> The project focuses on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze past loan data and identify patterns that indicate whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan. The goal is to reduce financial risk by understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults, which can help the company make informed lending decisions.

## General Information
- This project involves a consumer finance company specializing in lending loans to urban customers. When a loan application is received, the company needs to decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicantâ€™s profile. The key business     challenge is to minimize the financial risk by identifying applicants who are likely to default, thereby preventing potential credit loss. The data includes past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not, and the analysis will focus on determining patterns associated with loan default.
- The background revolves around minimizing credit loss for the lending company. By analyzing the historical loan data, the company can predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The project explores the application of EDA in understanding how different applicant and loan attributes impact the likelihood of default, enabling the company to make better, data-driven lending decisions.
- The business problem is to identify risky loan applicants who are more likely to default. By doing so, the company can take preemptive actions such as rejecting loans, offering loans at higher interest rates, or reducing loan amounts for high-risk applicants, ultimately minimizing financial losses from loan defaults.
- We are using existing loan dataset.
